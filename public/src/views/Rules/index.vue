        <li>Locations can be anything. Try not to be illegal n stuff.</li>
        <li>Enter correct stats. The league creator will be prompted to verify them after every game, and it'll just be annoying if you lie.</li>

      <h2>League Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Win = 10 Points</b></li>
        <li><b>1B = 1 Point</b></li>
        <li><b>2B = 2 Points</b></li>
        <li><b>3B = 3 Points</b></li>
        <li><b>HR = 4 Points</b></li>
        <li>No defensive points are awarded. That will be reflected in your ability to stop the other team's offense</li>
        <li>Teams are random every game! The league creator does not get to choose teams; they only choose dates and locations</li>
        <li>League Creators: Feel free to set the location of games to "any" in hopes that the players will communicate appropriately and find a location</li>
        <li>In the event of any disagreements, contact the league creator first. If not resolved, <i>then</i> go through the websites contact page</li>
        <li>Leagues can set their own rules in the "About League" section such as number of innings, time limits, or whatever else. These rules are just a base set of rules to try and have a little bit of organization</li>
